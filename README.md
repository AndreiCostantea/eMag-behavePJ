I have created this project to help me improve my behave tests skills. 
I enjoyed to work on this project as I have learned to manage obstacles
more effectively. 

Some tests from the login page are not working if you don't manually get 
past the anti bot system (test22, test23, test25). Also, test25 will need
a confirmation code after the login is successful.

You can see the tests in the "Tests" folder. 
The tests were made by using the command: 
behave -f html -o reportName.html --tags=tagName
